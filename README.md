# OpenCV - Learnings and Takeaways from FreeCodeCamp.org's Computer Vision and AI with OpenCV

## Chap 1
 Basics Operation in Open CV
	Jupyter notebook the outlines:
	* Reading an image 
	* Check image attributes like datatype and shape 
	* Matrix representation of an image in Numpy
	* Color Images and splitting/merging image channels
	* Displaying images using matplotlib
	* Saving images

## Chap 2
Basic Image Manipulations Jupyter Notebook
In this notebook we will cover how to perform image transformations including:

* Accessing and manipulating images pixels 
* Image resizing
* Cropping
* Flipping

## Chap 3
 Jupyter Notebook- In this notebook we will cover how to annotate images using OpenCV. We will learn how to peform the following annotations to images.

* Draw lines 
* Draw circles
* Draw rectangles
* Add text

These are useful when you want to annotate your results for presentations or show a demo of your application. Annotations can also be useful during development and debugging.

## Chap 4 
 Jupyter Notebook - Image Processing with Math 
* Arithmetic Operations like addition, multiplication
* Thresholding & Masking
* Bitwise Operations like OR, AND, XOR

## Chap 5
  Python Code snippet to access camera - Run it in your fav IDE - Visual Studio Code or Pycharm

## Chap 6
  Jupyter Notebook - While building applications, it becomes important to save demo videos of your work as well as many applications themselves might require saving a video clip. For example, in a surveiallance application, you might have to save a video clip as soon as you see something unusual happening.

This notebook describes how to save a video in **avi** and **mp4** formats using openCV.
